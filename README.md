# BrownianBees
##Introduction
Suppose we have N particles starting from the origin and undergoing dyadic Branching Brownian Motion (Brownian Motion with particles dividing in two after some exponential random time). Now suppose each time a particle divides, the particle closer to the barycenter of the system is eliminated. 

This repository includes code to simulate this brownian bees system and to analyze its long-term behaviour 

The repository contains two files (excluding ReadMe and License), which are: 
- helpFunctions.py: Which includes functions useful in the main file
- main.py         : Containing the code for the simulations 


##Future improvements 
- Add parallelism (pretty easy)
